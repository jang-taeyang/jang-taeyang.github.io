This Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) collobarated with the Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory in the design and development of a low-cost 1U CubeSat, with the ability to capture images of the Hawaiian Islands, utilized through the applied concepts of machine learning for autonomous image recognition. It contributed to systems engineering, testing, integration, while allowing for enhanced workforce development and aerospace education. A multidisciplinary team is worked with to deliver an affordable, spaceflight-ready satellite, advancing Hawaii's technological infrastructure supporting NASA's Artemis CubeSat Kit initiative. 

Under the software division, we were responsible for the testing and integration of the CubeSat's flight software, ground control systems, and mission operations framework. Tasks such as implementing onboard algorithms for image recognition, attitude control, and data management were utilized under the COSMOS software for real-time telemetry, command execution, and file transfers throughout the mission operations.
