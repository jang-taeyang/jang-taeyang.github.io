    "summary": "I am an ambitious and dedicated student pursuing a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Master of Science (M.S.) in Computer Engineering in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa. I previously graduated from the same institution with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Sociology in Fall 2019. As a participant in the University's BAM (Bachelor's and Master's) program, I am on an accelerated pathway to achieve both degrees. I expect to graduate with my B.S. in Spring 2025 and anticipate completing my M.S. by Fall 2026.",
