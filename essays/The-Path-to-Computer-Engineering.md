## The Path to Computer Engineering
In December 2019, I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology. I only achieved this degree to graduate from a university and make my parents proud. I never had an interest in any major until the counselor that I met with, in freshman year, led me to declare sociology. I was told that it was available online, completely until I graduate so I took it. My focus in life since an early age was to work instead of attempting to achieve a higher education for a better job. I was committed to moving out of my parents house and living on my own terms. Shortly after I graduated, the pandemic hit and it gave me a lot of time to think about my life. I was thinking about going for a Masters degree in Business Administration but my parents disagreed because they believed that I should pursue a degree that is required for a job. They believed that if I really wanted a business, I wouldnt need a degree for it.
