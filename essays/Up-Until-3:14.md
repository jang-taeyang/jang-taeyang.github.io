## Introduction <img src="../img/Introduction-Logo.jpg" width="40px" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 10px;">
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed the landscape of education, offering innovative solutions for problem-solving, learning, and project development. In fields where software engineering plays a pivotal role, AI has emerged as a highly valuable tool for automating code, enhancing productivity, debugging programs, and guiding users through complex concepts.

At the University of Hawaii at Manoa, ICS 314 is the first curriculum course that openly incorporates AI tools, allowing students to explore their potential in software engineering tasks. Throughout this course, I learned to utilize two primary AI applications: ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. These tools proved invaluable for generating code templates, identifying issues, brainstorming solutions, and troubleshooting errors efficiently. Without access to these applications, completing assignments and project tasks within the given deadlines would have been significantly more challenging.

However, the integration of AI into academic life presents its own set of challenges, particularly when it comes to exercising self-discipline and using these tools as learning aids rather than shortcuts. Striking a balance between leveraging AI for assistance and maintaining the independence required to fully grasp concepts is essential.

This essay reflects on my personal experiences using AI in ICS 314, analyzing its impact on my learning, understanding, and practical applications within the field of software engineering.
